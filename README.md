Background:

With the popularity of card digital cameras, digital photos have become more and more media for ordinary families to store memories. However, due to various reasons during digital photo shooting, the expressiveness of photos is insufficient, and digital photos need to be repaired.
The need for digital photo post-processing continues increase. Picture editors are the products of this era. The current application of picture editor is mainly to repair and enhance digital photos.

Proposal:

For non-professional users, it is only the most basic functions of the software that can be used.
In our project, we designed a website where users upload images online and then edit the images. 
For non-professional users, this is very convenient. It can also meet their basic needs for images.
